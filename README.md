# Eleckart_MMM

ElecKart is a leading e-commerce chain based in Ontario, Canada, specialising in electronic products. The company serves as a technology provider for a free but regulated marketplace and deals with all the top-end and low-end brands to cater to different types of customers.

# Problem Statement

The brand has shown commendable growth in just a few years of its operation. However, over the last one year, ElecKart has faced a revenue dip even after spending a significant amount of money on marketing and promotions. There was a high customer churn ratio because the company was failing to understand customer demographics and cater to the needs of their customers.

The following tasks are to be done:
- Root cause analysis for optimised operations
- SPIN Selling Framework
- Juptyer Notebook for the codes
- PPT for best results of the market mix model for each of the three product subcategories
